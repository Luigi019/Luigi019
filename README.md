I am an IT Engineer and Full-stack Developer with 4 years of experience creating innovative digital solutions. Throughout my career, I have worked with technologies such as PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and notably Laravel. In addition, I have expanded my expertise by incorporating modern frameworks and languages including Angular, Vue, NextJS, React, and Java.

My focus is on implementing best practices and continuous learning, which has enabled me to tackle complex challenges in high-demand projects. I complement my technical profile with skills in using prompts for artificial intelligence and actively exploring emerging technologies, such as Blockchain, while continuously improving my proficiency in English.

Self-taught, curious, and passionate about technology, I am always in search of new challenges that drive digital transformation and enrich my professional growth.

As an AVAA graduate, I have learned about the importance of cultural exchange and education, values that have enriched my perspective and my ability to work in teams. I am committed to developing technological solutions that make a difference and add value to society.
