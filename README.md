I am an IT engineer and junior full-stack web developer, with 3 years of experience in PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, Laravel, and ReactJS, focused on implementing good practices, constant learning, and seeking new professional challenges.

In addition to my academic background and work experience, I have developed skills in creating innovative technological solutions, and have knowledge in using prompts for AI. I consider myself self-taught, curious, and passionate about technology, which has led me to explore new technologies such as JavaScript frameworks, Blockchain technologies, and English.

As an AVAA graduate, I have learned about the importance of cultural exchange and education, values that have enriched my perspective and my ability to work in teams. I am committed to developing technological solutions that make a difference and add value to society.
